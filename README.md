# Faucet-GUI
Faucet (Faucet, n.d.) is an open-source Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller designed to provide a hardware independent solution suitable for various software and hardware switches. 

Faucet is configured primarily through YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) text files and while YAML is a human-readable data serialization format (Ben-Kiki, Evans, & Ingerson, 2009), the complex configuration of a network can make it difficult to understand what is actually configured just from looking at the configuration file. This is especially true in larger scale networks where configuration files are large and settings difficult to locate. In addition, simple things like incorrect indentation, spelling mistakes, or incorrect grammar can cause configuration file failures or network issues. 

This project is aimed at making the configuration process of a Faucet SDN device significantly more intuitive by creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that manages Faucetâ€™s YAML configuration files. It will be significantly easier for users to change configurations and avoid errors easily made when manually changing configuration files (Piccolo, Ence, Anderson, Chang, & Bild, 2021). The GUI functionality will include opening existing files and displaying the settings or starting a new file. Appropriate options for the configuration settings will be controlled by the GUI and users will be able to save over an existing file or create a new configuration file.
